# Recursion
Concept by [Tim Fowers](http://www.fowers.net/), Development By [Louis Tovar](http://www.gltovar.com/), Music by [CaptainMitch](http://captainmitch.newgrounds.com/)

[Here is where you can find the current version](https://github.com/gltovar/recursion/tree/master/source/export/flash/bin)

The first concept can be found here: http://www.fowers.net/recursion.html
>What if Pac-man happened in a time loop?    Fight alongside yourselves. If one of your team dies, you have to change the past to save him. But you can't ignore you own past or you might get erased. Because in the end, history is written by the winner.

Not satisfied with the way that version controls, this iteration was born.

The controls are basic just UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are used. During character selection:
* Rock = Left
* Paper = Up
* Scissors = Right

Up to 4 players can play. Here are the control key variations:
* WASD
* IJKL 
* Arrow Keys
* 5 1 2 3 (Numpad)
